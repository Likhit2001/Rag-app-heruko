  - 'Performance-wise, it''s difficult to peg down who had the best stage presence,
    because I was impressed by different elements from each go-round. Pop Evil was
    more well-known, so naturally the crowd carried a higher excitement level, but
    I also just felt a solid energized rock vibe from them as a whole. They would
    probably take the cake for best appearance as well, since the lead singer Leigh
    Kakaty (a dude) was probably the hottest person on stage that night, and the luscious
    locks of long hair on the bassist Matt Dirito were tantalizing to watch as he
    expertly headbanged his way to a promising migraine. Seriously, this guy came
    on stage and I immediately thought, "He has Pocahontas'' hair, and it''s way prettier
    than mine! Not fair." If you''ve never payed attention to anyone whipping such
    long hair like that around in the air, it''s quite a sight, let me tell you. I
    used to just think it was cool and all if the rockstars want to get a little crazy
    while playing their instruments, but it''s actually FUN to watch. Is it weird
    of me to think that? I hope I''m not the only one that does.

    Matt Dirito.

    at the concert. This is a la internet.

    Even before Pop Evil dazzled the audience with their catchy songs and pumped up
    attitude, Aranda surprised me with a few tricks up their own sleeve. At first
    I didn''t realize the guys setting up the equipment in plaid flannel and skinny
    jeans were the actual band, but when they started playing they definitely didn''t
    sound like any emo posers. The guitarist Damien Aranda was especially skilled,
    as displayed most prominently during their cover of Led Zep''s "Dazed and Confused."
    After that face melter, they did some cool things with the guitar where the lead
    singer would hold it parallel to the ground while Damien sort of played the strings
    like a keyboard, even going so far as to pull what I''m assuming is his signature
    move and use his designer boot to play the instrument at the same time. He used
    a delicate sweeping motion over the strings, which made a really cool effect when
    paired with the high speed plucking thing. It was very unique, something I have
    never seen or heard of before.

    Black Cloud Collective''s performance was unfortunately mediocre. I have a feeling
    their tracks are probably better on a CD than you would observe from hearing them
    live, because the volume of their many sounds together was so loud over the singer''s
    voice, you could barely hear the melodies in their songs. When I did catch a glimpse
    of some kind of musical pattern, I thought, "That''s actually not bad, but I wish
    I could understand some of the words," because yeah, the sound levels were a little
    imbalanced, but also the lead singer was not an articulate one at all. My friend
    commented about him not quite looking the part, which I felt too, but on the other
    hand I liked that the majority of the other guys sported rugged beards as their
    go-to hair style, because it was different from most of the bands I''ve seen.

    By the time Rev Theory finally came on, people were anxious to hear the band they''d
    been waiting for, but sadly more than one technical problem led to a performance
    that didn''t live up to expectations. The microphone was doing a horrible job
    at picking up sound, so the lead singer Rich Luzzi (who looked like a cross between
    Stanley Tucci and my more attractive cousin, Greg) basically had to scream his
    lungs out for us to hear anything, and frankly that just sounded bad. On a side
    note, I just googled Luzzi and found some awesome pictures of him with a different
    look, one that included many ripped muscles and a lack of upper body clothing.
    I may rescind my statement that Leigh Kakaty was the hottest person on stage.
    But anyway, the vocal problems were a let down, and I honestly expected to hear
    more songs that I knew. The only redeeming factor was that the last two songs
    of the night - "Hell Yeah" and "Justice" - were the most kickass in their repertoire,
    and completely filled up my satisfaction bar.

    All in all I was pleased with the bang for my buck ($13), since I had mostly been
    exposed to bands that I''ll probably get some music from in the near future. I
    quite enjoyed my time at this venue that I''d never been to before. Typically
    at concerts I can get cranky real easily if I''m standing the entire night, especially
    between bands when there is nothing going on. Luckily this place had rows of rectangular
    block benches that we could rest on while waiting for the next band, and that
    might''ve been one of the contributing factors to the night being a success. Feet
    and back aches were minimal, and I was able to maintain a *lovely* personal space
    bubble because the place wasn''t jam-packed, and we happened to pick one of the
    best spots in the room to sit. The only thing that needed fixing was their bathroom
    - two stalls is not enough for a hundred women. But that won''t deter me from
    attending concerts at this venue again (ask me the name if you''re interested)
    because like I said, it was a successful night. Thus ends my post on the 9th concert
    of my life so far!

    And listen to that song up there. It''s one of my faves, possibly ever. In the
    category of hyped up rock, anyway.

  - 'When Hannah from Layer Home first got in touch, I knew that I had met a kindred
    spirit – someone who had a love of interiors and old things and a lot of energy
    for a project she really believed in.

    Layer Home is currently a website filled with articles about design, styling,
    and antiques. It is the brainchild of Hannah (a digital guru) and Denise (a property
    development and expert), a mother-daughter team (even more to love!). We can’t
    tell you too much, but there are exciting things afoot at Layer, so STAY TUNED!

    We caught up with them (in Denise’s beautiful garden) and asked for the pair to
    share some of their thoughts on design, inspiration, and collecting.

    Denise: These photos are taken in the garden of my house, which is an Arts and
    Crafts property in a pretty village called Englefield Green, Surrey. The house
    used to be the old doctor’s surgery, and the original shutters are still on the
    outside of the house now. I’ve lived here for seven years and still love it.

    Where do you find inspiration?

    Hannah: Everywhere! Instagram is a constant source of inspiration. Since we launched
    Layer on Instagram earlier this year, we have been consistently amazed and inspired
    by so many beautiful photos taken by talented bloggers and photographers within
    the interiors space.

    But we also find inspiration from nature, fashion, shopfronts, people walking
    down the street – all over the place. Sometimes it’s nice to switch everything
    off and step away from the online world to give yourself the space to be creative.

    How do you combine style and comfort?

    Hannah: Thinking about how the space will actually work and be lived in is something
    that we believe in strongly. There’s just no point creating beautiful spaces that
    are uninhabitable or impractical for the people using them everyday (we agree!).
    We like to think carefully about where everything should sit from the word go
    – it’s not glamorous, but people forget how important putting plug sockets in
    the right place can be!

    Which are your favourite places in your home?

    <Denise: The garden lodge tucked away in a secluded spot at the end of the garden
    is definitely my favourite place. We built it from scratch a few years ago on
    a pretty tight budget – but it’s now my oasis of calm to take a cup of tea in
    the morning and practice some yoga.

    Hannah: The courtyard in my house is definitely a triumph! It is very white and
    light, and when we pull back the full-length doors from the kitchen it really
    feels like one, really large room. The antique mirrors on the fence reflect back
    the light and make the space feel even bigger.

    Describe the favourite pieces in your home and tell us the stories behind them.

    Denise: My favourite painting is by Thomas McGregor who is an artist based in
    London and it’s an abstract piece called Trees on Park. It’s in a beautiful gold,
    gilt frame and the juxtaposition of traditional gilt frame and modern painting
    works fantastically. The blue, pink and green tones work beautifully in my dining
    room. I’ve just recently started buying artwork as I was quite intimidated by
    it before. Now I just buy pieces that I fall in love with! This painting was purchased
    from Mark at Ebury Trading.

    Hannah: I visited Ardingly market last week and picked up the yellow and white
    1960s woven plastic chair. I just can’t get enough of it! It’s outside in my courtyard
    now that the weather is nice and it just gives a great pop of colour to the white
    space. It’s very comfortable and feels quite ‘Mad Men’-esque!

    Tell us about how you use your outside space? What do you love about it?

    Hannah: The outside space was something that sold my house to me. In the summer,
    it literally gives us another room in the house and it’s where we eat breakfast
    and dinner, practice yoga and less glamourously, dry our washing! It’s also perfect
    for Friday evening drinks with friends – we open up the doors from the kitchen,
    light the tealights and get some cocktails going.

    One tip for anyone looking to restyle their outdoor space.

    Don’t be afraid to bring ‘inside furniture’ outside. Some of our most favourite
    events have involved heavy lifting of sofas and chairs and rugs outside, even
    if only for a short period of time.

    You can also buy special outside rugs which really make the space feel welcoming
    and cosy. They can stay outside in the summer and roll up into a shed for the
    dark, winter months. Throw some cushions down on them for a perfect spot to relax.

    Best kept secret shops for interiors?

    There are too many to name!

    Most recently we discovered midcentury furniture dealers Hutch Interiors and House
    of Twenty. They both have beautiful stock and would certainly be our first point
    of call for a statement chair or sofa.

    We also regularly make the journey to Sunbury Antiques Market and Ardingly Antiques
    Market (Josie: Take me with you!). They can be hit or miss, but if you pick a
    sunny day when all of the traders have made the trip over from Europe, there is
    such a buzz. Get there for when the doors open before everything gets snapped
    up!

    Thank you so much, Denise and Hannah, for spending time with us and showing us
    your beautiful garden! Stay tuned for more coming from these talented women at
    Layer Home!

  - 'Good morning! As my regular readers know, I am a Halloween FREAK, and I am so
    excited to share my daughter’s Halloween Maxi Skirt with you today. My kids have
    an unreasonable amount of Halloween clothing and accessories, just as I have an
    unreasonable amount of Halloween decorations, and I make most of them because
    I don’t love what I can find cheap and I don’t want to spend boutique prices for
    items like this skirt. I would love to share a tutorial with you for my little
    love’s Halloween Maxi Skirt so that you can make one as well!

    I used THIS tutorial and adapted it to make this skirt. If my instructions don’t
    make sense to you then refer to that tutorial and see if it helps to clarify things.

    In order to make this Halloween Maxi Skirt you will need five Halloween fabrics
    (or however many you would like to use), elastic, thread, and basic sewing supplies
    (machine, scissors, etc.).

    First you are going to figure out how long to cut your strips. First determine
    how long you would like your skirt by measuring from your child’s waist to where
    you would like it to fall. I needed mine to be about 20 inches long, so with five
    strips I needed each strip to be about 4 inches wide. I added two inches to the
    top strip so that I would have fabric to create the casing for the elastic waistband,
    and I added 1/2 inch to the bottom strip for the hem.

    For the length of each strip I did 1.5 times the length of the previous strip.
    You may not need to do quite that much extending. The bottom layers were very
    long and ruffled, but I do love the way that it twirls and moves! I also 1.5 times
    of her waist measurement for the top strip.

    Here are my measurements. Yours will be different, unless you are also sewing
    for a 2T/3T child. You will notice the ratios aren’t exact. They don’t really
    need to be. It’s a very forgiving look. The long strips are just multiple cuts
    of fabric sewn together.

    6″ x 30″ (extra width for waistband casing)

    4″ x 45″

    4″ x 67″

    4″ x 101″

    4.5″ x 151″ (extra width for hem)

    Begin by gathering/ruffling your strips. Baste one side (use a very long stitch
    and do NOT backstitch at the beginning OR the end of the strip) and then hold
    one string and use your fingers to push and bunch the fabric. It’s quite a process
    with those long strips! Do it in front of a funny tv show.

    Right sides facing one another, pin the gathered/ruffled top of the second strip
    to the bottom of the first strip. Sew into place and remove the pins. (This time
    you use a regular length stitch and DO backstitch as you start and end your sewing!)

    Once the pins have been removed, iron the layer flat a bit so that you can go
    back and top stitch along the edge of the newly connected strips to help secure
    them and ensure that they will lay flat.

    Repeat this process with all of the strips.

    Once you are to your last strip you can create your hem by folding the bottom
    edge of the last strip in 1/4″ and ironing it. Fold it up by 1/4″ one more time
    and iron. Stitch it down to make the hem permanent.

    Now, right sides together, line up the edge of your skirt and sew up the sides.
    Trim any excess edges that don’t line up quite right.

    Now you will create the casing for the elastic waistband of your skirt. Fold the
    top edge of the first strip in about 1/4″ and iron down. Now fold it in at least
    1″ and iron it down. Sew this into place BUT LEAVE AN OPENING SO THAT YOU CAN
    THREAD THE ELASTIC THROUGH THE CASING!

    For waistbands I usually cut the elastic about 2″ smaller than her waist measurement.
    To thread elastic I always safety pin one end to the garment so I won’t lose it
    and accidentally pull it through. I also put a safety pin on the loose end so
    that I can easily grip it to push it through. Push and scrunch and tug and adjust
    until the elastic is all the way through. Sew the ends together. (I usually use
    a zig zag to make it extra secure.) Now sew the opening in the casing closed and
    you are DONE!

    Isn’t she just to die for cute?!

    Now let your little gal go roam around and twirl and play and show off her fabulous
    new Halloween Maxi Skirt! (Please try to ignore my neighbor’s dying grass.) 😉

    I love the way it moves, and I think it will fit her again next year, although
    it may be more of a midi skirt length by then!

    I hope this tutorial inspired you to make a fun Halloween skirt for your little
    lady! (Or, heck, YOURSELF!)

    UPDATE: Here are a few more pictures of it in action on an outing. 🙂

    Here are a few more Halloween posts that you may enjoy:

  - 'Symbolized by the popular four leaf clover, St. Patrick’s Day means a lot of
    things to different people. A religious holiday, a celebration of an ethnicity’s
    history in America, or a reason to party, there are many reasons to love March
    17. We would like to add one more: St. Patrick’s Day is a great chance to review
    how B2B companies can successfully close the customer loop with inbound marketing.

    How come we can do this? Why is the four leaf clover lucky – not only for the
    Irish, but for just about anyone involved in digital marketing?

    Just like St. Patrick used the four leaf clover to teach about Catholicism, we
    use the four leaf clover to demonstrate what HubSpot calls the “Four Marketing
    Actions”. Complete these actions well, and you won’t even need the four leaf clover’s
    luck!

    Lucky Clover Leaf 1: Attract

    Driving qualified traffic (the types of people who are most likely to buy your
    product or subscribe to your service) to your brand’s digital properties is an
    essential component to digital marketing. Smart marketers know exactly what these
    types encompass; they create buyer personas or buyer profiles that include goals,
    challenges, and typical problems to which the brand’s offering is a solution,
    as well as general demographics that describe the ideal buyer. For B2Bs, this
    information includes job title and description, goals for that position, challenges
    that individuals face when trying to accomplish this goal, and reasons why that
    individual might turn to the brand as a solution.

    Knowing what an ideal buyer needs – and needs to know – makes it much easier to
    build enticing attractions that will guide them to your brand. What are those
    attractions? Content. Blogs, social media accounts, landing pages, and optimized
    web pages are all great content pieces that will attract that qualified traffic.

    Lucky Clover Leaf 2: Convert

    Most B2Bs have a longer sales cycle. While expecting a first-time online visitor
    to make a purchase is a little unrealistic, you do want to make an initial interaction
    that you can follow up to move them closer to a purchase. Creating opportunities
    to collect visitors’ contact information – converting that traffic into leads
    – is crucial to facilitating this process. Usually, conversion is a give-and-take
    process; offering a visitor an exclusive gift, such as a promotion, or extensive
    content piece in exchange for their contact information is the best way to organically
    establish the initial conversion. How do you create these exchanges? Create compelling
    calls-to-action, contact forms, and email contact are all useful to converting.

    Lucky Clover Leaf 3: Close

    Compelling your leads to purchase your product or service is how brands make their
    profits; it’s easier to do so online when you have established an inbound marketing
    rapport with a lead, and you use certain tools and tactics to ensure that you’re
    speaking to each lead at the right time. Action-triggered automated emails, a
    lead-scoring process, and greater insight into a customer relationship management
    (CRM) system can all help you and your team create customers out of leads.

    Lucky Clover Leaf 4: Delight

    Here’s that lucky fourth leaf that takes a clover – or an inbound marketing strategy
    – and elevates it to something truly special. When that lead makes a purchase
    and becomes a customer, your job isn’t finished. In order to compel them to make
    repeat purchases, and to increase their lifetime value to your company, you should
    continue the process you’ve already begun with them: deliver unique, relevant
    content. Furthermore, strategies such as customized calls-to-action, social media,
    and email campaigns will keep then keep them informed and involved with your brand.
    This system will increase their trust and loyalty to your brand, and will make
    you a go-to solution for that customer.

    Inbound marketing takes a lot of work: strategy – and sometimes a tiny bit of
    luck. And yet, at the end of the day, this is precisely what sets great brands
    and marketers apart. Keep that four leaf clover handy, and you’ll reap the benefits
    of a well-built inbound marketing strategy!

    Need help with figuring out how to best apply the “four leaf clover” strategy
    to your brand? As a HubSpot Partner, inSegment is qualified in inbound digital
    marketing strategy and execution. Make your own luck and contact us today to get
    started down the right path!'

    Lunch at Mi Ranchito II, 4.28.2012

    Art and I bopped down to Mi Ranchito II, at the very end of Manchaca Rd, on FM
    1626 for a book meeting (the one we are writing and the one we want to be writing)
    this past Saturday. Mi Ranchito II has been one of our top five Austin spots for
    authentic Mexican food for over a year now. The others are El Taco Rico, La Fruta
    Feliz, Taco More, and Rosita''s al Pastor (for pastor tacos). But this isn''t
    about them, it''s about Ranchito Two. Ranchito One is on Wm Cannon at Pleasant
    Valley, taking up a cramped half of a gas station/ice house interior, behind depressing
    burglar bars. Ranchito Two is much larger (but still not huge) with a bigger menu
    and better parking...plus, it''s a lot closer to far south Austin, and NOT on
    the dreaded and heavy traffic-prone Wm.Cannon Blvd. I''d rather poke my eyes out
    with a dull stick than go through the intersection of Wm. Cannon and IH 35 to
    get to Ranchito Uno, and then you''ll prolly have to wait for a table.

    EVERYTHING I have tasted at Ranchito Two has been excellent, and though purist
    detractors like R.L. carp about the tortillas not being hand-patted before your
    eyes, R Two still manages to put out amazing food. Truth be told, if they aren''t
    gonna make their own tortillas, I''d love to see them start getting them from
    Tortilleria Rio Grande #2 on Cannon, just east of South 1st....they have excellent
    tortillas and totopos. I digress......

    One of the better things about Ranchito Two is the salsa bar. They have two versions
    of the classic jalapeño and avocado green salsa, with one of them being incendiary
    and the other a little more tame. They have a couple of reds, one the typical
    moderately spicy casera-style house red, and a smoky charred red with elevated
    heat levels. There is a new red that they have in a smaller container that''s
    dark, complex, and delish, and then they have the requisite pico de gallo (with
    lots of spicy chile in it), and limes. You serve your self at the salsa bar.

    Art opted for a brace of carnitas tacos and a gringa al pastor. Their carinitas
    and pastor are both really good. The gringa is a quesadilla-like unit loaded with
    pastor meat and cheese (although it can be any of the meats they offer: picadillo,
    carnitas, pastor, carne asado, chorizo, tongue, deshrebada, suadero/rib, barbacoa,
    fajita, etc. etc etc.).

    I went for my ole stalwart: the pork with green salsa platter, which also comes
    with some manteca-ized refried beans, rich rice, and a salad topped with avocado
    slices. The green sauce is excellent, more green chiles and herbs than tomatillo,
    and the braised pork always melts in the mouth. I couldn''t pass up a chorizo
    and nopalito taco as well. The seconds shot is after I have applied my salsa,
    to jazz it up even more. That plate explodes with flavor. So good.......

    They have added combo plates now that have their plump chile relleno on them.
    The burgers are really meaty and juicy, and the tamales (available now in savory
    and sweet versions) are incredible: well-stuffed in a casing of masa as light
    as a cloud. They sell a lot of tamales. They sell a lot because they are so good.
    The enchiladas come in sets of three, smothered with savory sauce. The caldo de
    res is really chunky, meaty, and rich, and the sopes, huaraches, and gorditas
    excel. For breakfast egg and machacada, or chorizo and nopalito tacos, or a platter
    of migas for me. I''ve never eaten anything here that I didn''t love. It''s a
    friendly, family-run operation, and our go-to spot in the neighborhood.

  - 'Manchester United expert tells Hammers News that Jesse Lingard to West Ham in
    January could be very much on in order to avoid a PR disaster.

    Another week, another round of frenzied speculation linking Lingard with a return
    to West Ham.

    This time feels different, though. Sparked by the Man United bench-warmer himself.

    Lingard posted a picture of himself celebrating during his time at West Ham on
    the day Sky Sports reported talks over a new Red Devils contract had collapsed.
    He also commented on a West Ham post about a goal he scored to which Declan Rice
    responded.

    Hammers fans are convinced Lingard is on his way back to the London Stadium in
    January.

    But as pointed out by Hammers News, there are surely big question marks over whether
    Man United would allow him to join West Ham.

    After all David Moyes’s side are a direct rival for a Champions League place and
    currently six points ahead of Man United in the table.

    Since then Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been sacked at Old Trafford which could threaten
    to change the landscape too.

    Exclusive: Manchester United expert says Jesse Lingard to West Ham could be very
    much on to avoid PR disaster

    But Manchester United expert and United in Focus writer Dan Coombs has exclusively
    explained to Hammers News why Lingard to West Ham in January could be very much
    on.

    “I would imagine another loan is out of the question to West Ham, given the league
    position and the contract situation,” Coombs told Hammers News.

    “When it comes to selling, I think we will take what we can get. United should
    be trying to do right by him.

    “The reason why it could happen, is Lingard has been with us eight-nine years,
    he’s given us an awful lot, and we should let him make the move he wants, providing
    the price is reasonable – £10-15m should do it.

    ‘Stop it becoming more of a PR disaster, we haven’t treated him well recently’

    “Let him carry on with his career elsewhere, give him the move of his choice and
    stop it becoming more of a PR disaster. If that’s West Ham, then fair enough.

    “We have been a bit petty with denying (Marcos) Rojo a move to Everton once, for
    similar reasons, but Lingard has more credit. Rojo had only been at the club for
    two years.

    “Lingard has given so much more, and to be fair, we haven’t treated him well recently.

    “Bear in mind, this is all subject to what a new manager may want to do. Can he
    be talked around over the next month? I do think it is time to move on, and Lingard
    probably shouldn’t get suckered in again.

    “I think the chance to leave as a free agent appeals to him – but United’s board
    should not pass up a chance to make some money, considering how they messed up
    an opportunity to do so in the summer.”'

  - 'In January, I announced that instead of a word of the year, I was going to claim
    a hymn of the year. The hymn I chose is one of my favorites – Great is Thy Faithfulness.
    I shared a printable the beginning of January with Great is Thy Faithfulness lyrics.
    In case you missed it, you can find it HERE.

    A few days later, I was humming/singing Great is Thy Faithfulness and these lyrics
    jumped out at me – “morning by morning new mercies I see”. I had just put away
    the large “NOEL” sign that was hanging above our headboard and decided to create
    a new sign with these special lyrics! What a great reminder to see each morning!

    This size is perfect to hang over a sofa, buffet, dresser, or headboard. This
    size sign is now priced at $120. I’ve adjusted my price a bit lower to keep in
    line with other sign makers. The sign measures 12″ x 48″ plus a 5/8″ frame.

    Currently, I have three signs for sale in this size.

    “Rise & Shine and Give God the Glory Glory”

    “Our Cheeks are Nice & Rosy and Comfy Cozy are We”

    “As For Me and My House, We Will Serve the Lord”

    Even though I like these large “statement” signs, I know many have asked if I
    would consider making these signs in a smaller size. So, I have decided to do
    just that. I am now making all of these signs available in a smaller size – 9.5″
    x 24″ plus a 5/8″ frame. This size sign is priced at $50. Here’s the smaller size
    of Morning by Morning New Mercies I See.

    If you’d like to purchase a sign or any other products I sell in my Hymns & Verses
    Etsy Shop, just click on the image below! Thanks so much for all your sweet comments
    about this sign. I’m so glad you like the design! Have a great weekend, friends!

    I don’t see the new sized sign on your etsy site???

    There was a technical glitch with Etsy, but it’s all fixed now. You can order
    any of the signs in two sizes now.

    I would love to purchase some of the new smaller signs, but did not see them on
    your etsy site yet. Any timeline for them to be there? Thanks so much. I love
    your blog. Have been a subscriber for several years and have used your tutorials.
    Thanks so much for a Christian influence online. I know God approves.😇

    Thanks so much for your sweet comment, Ruth! There was a technical glitch on Etsy,
    but everything is listed correctly now! You can choose sizes for each of the signs
    now.

    That is a lovely hymn! We sing it in church on occasion.

    Would love to purchase the beautiful 48″sign and your post mentions the cost is
    $120, but Etsy site says$150. Do we need a special code?

    Thank you for your time and sharing your talent

    Hi, Verna. I’m so glad you like the sign. Because I combined both sizes in one
    shop listing, I had to include the shipping and handling in the price listed.
    So, in actuality, the price of the sign is $120 and the shipping and handling
    for FedEx shipping is $30. I hope this clears up the misunderstanding.

    I too love your blog. I have a birthday coming up and will let the hubby know
    what I want. Great is thy Faithfulness was my mother’s favorite song and mine
    as well. The older you get the more you appreciate God’s promises to us. I know
    just the place in my kitchen to see that sign every morning.

    Thanks so much, Gigi! I too love to give my hubs hints for my birthday!'

  - 'I’m just ONE person, working towards my gaols ONE day at a time, and sharing
    the journey ONE blog post at a time.

    Reflecting back on the last 9 months I’ve realized an amazing thing, there is
    SOOOOO much power in one. I’ve been able to connect with hundreds of amazing men
    and women around the world. Not only have I heard their stories and goals, but
    I’ve also heard that I, in small way helped inspire them. WOW!

    I want to drop a tear every time someone sends me a note, leaves me a message
    or shoots me an email. Everyone is so touching and heart felt, and means the world
    to me. It’s am amazing feeling to know that I’ve been able to effect just one
    person in a positive way.

    Why do people feel inspired by me? I guess I’m not really sure, but here’s what
    I think. I am real. I am authentic. I am myself. I struggle everyday just like
    everyone else, the only difference between me and someone else is that I share
    that with the world.

    Am I afraid people will judge me, of course.

    Am I afraid people will think I’m a babbling idiot, of course.

    Am I afraid I don’t know what I’m doing, of course.

    But I don’t let that stop me from being me.

    I challenge you to share your story. Your story is important! Tell it…unedited….unabrigged…..
    You have a story, and that gives you the ability to connect and effect even just
    one person. There is power in ONE, use it.

    7 thoughts on “The Power of One”

    This is why I keep writing on my blog. Someone somewhere will read something I
    write and be inspired, will learn something, will take a challenge.

    I share some of your feelings as well.

    Thanks for this blog. I feel silly when I give you comments about how you inspire
    me, so I won’t feel silly anymore. I decided to take your advice tonight Kate
    and wrote an unedited and unabridged version of my struggle right now. I hope
    it helps get me over this stumbling block.

    By the way, I have not been back to Crossfit because I scared myself away. I did
    my first WOD not part of the executive series and hurt for three days and beat
    myself up for not finishing because I was on a time crunch. I will be back, hopefully.

    Thanks for this blog. I feel silly sometimes writing comments here about how you
    inspire me, like I am the kid brown nosing it up to the teacher. LOL.

    I will be back to Crossfit soon, hopefully. I scare myself away after my first
    WOD outside of the executive series. I beat myself up for not finishing even though
    I had to leave due to my schedule.

    I think you nailed the reasons right on the head Kate. I’ve already taken on your
    challenge not too long ago. Inspired in part by your blog.

    I’ve had some words of encouragement, and a couple people at the box mentioned
    to me that they had taken a look at it. (Actually, one guy mentioned that he and
    his wife noticed that I hadn’t updated in a few days. Little did I know at that
    point that anyone other than me had taken a look at it.)

    Being a ‘recovering perfectionist’, I initially wanted to have things ‘just right’
    before actually starting the blog, but decided to do the reverse. “Just start
    the damn thing and add to it/change it as I go.”

    I also initally had concerns about the reasons why I wanted to start a blog about
    my CrossFit story. That maybe I wanted to do it to feed my ego. After some additional
    thought, I came to the conclusion that I wanted some way to track my progress,
    and that there might be a remote possibility that the thoughts that go through
    my head during this whole process could potentially be useful to someone else.
    If nothing else, for a person to be able to realize that someone else is going
    through the same struggles and dealing with the same issues that they are, and
    that person was able to find a way …writing my own future here… to be successful.

    Anyway, thanks so much for sharing your journey with the world Kate!

    Don’t feel silly, I love the feedback. and don’t be scared of the box, you’re
    doing great! It’s tough, that’s why it’s so amazing. I expect to see you in the
    gym again, I don’t want to have to stalk you down, cause I will.

    Dave, I love that you’re sharing your journey. It’s amazing how you can touch
    people just by sharing the struggles and sticking with it. It’s a great way to
    keep yourself accountable as well. When you know others are reading it, you feel
    compelled to work hard so you don’t have to report bad numbers. ha! Keep telling
    your story….it’s helping others.

    “It’s a great way to keep yourself accountable as well. When you know others are
    reading it, you feel compelled to work hard so you don’t have to report bad numbers.
    ha! Keep telling your story….it’s helping others.”

    HA! Don’t I know it. The thought has gone through my mind more than once already,
    “Man, I should really do ‘X’ weight for this workout ’cause I don’t want to have
    to post something less on the blog.” Or many other similar thoughts.'

    to predict the effects on stats. Please note that the calculated final stats may
    be slightly different to the ones you actually see in the game, if you find any
    significant differences please send a query via the contact sheet below. Armour

    You must be running a fairly current version of Microsoft Excel for the Applier
    to work and you must have a suitable security level set to allow the running of
    macros.

    If you are migrating from a previous version of the applier and don’t fancy typing
    all those numbers in again what you need to do is copy the Character Library,

    Is it 2019 yet? Last Thursday (1°F in Boston that morning—OK, no competition with
    Minnesota, but still) I attended a program given by Suffolk University Law School’s
    Intellectual Property section on the subject of the public domain. This was in
    celebration of the fact that, for the first time in 20 years, works have started
    to age out of copyright coverage. Thus, works first published in the US in 1923,
    including classics of literature, art, music and film, are now free for everyone
    to use. Or pretty much so. One of the presenters at the program was an actor n

    Holy hypodermic, Batman! Since my exposure to the pharma industry is pretty tangential,
    I haven''t been following this dispute between Fresenius, a large German drug
    company, and Akorn, a US company it had agreed to acquire and then sought to drop
    like ein'' heißen Kartoffel. The Delaware Court of Chancery handed down its judgment
    in the case Monday in an opinion by Vice Chancellor Laster, and it''s quite remarkable--the
    opinion, for all its 246 pages, is quite the page-turner and discloses a pretty
    sordid set of facts. You can find the case here (). The detailed description of
    the facts ...read more

    An article published yesterday caught my eye in that it focused on a previously
    unremarked aspect of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement action
    I have been following. It''s worth mentioning here. A month or so ago the SEC
    brought a civil lawsuit against the founder of Mozido, a financial technology
    (fintech) company, alleging that he had fraudulently induced investors into putting
    money into companies he controlled, giving the investors to believe that they
    were investing in Mozido itself (Mozido is not a party to the SEC action). The
    factual settin ...read more

    An awful lot of people believe that they can research their own legal needs online
    and find a free or dirt-cheap legal form that will protect them in documenting
    their transactions. They’re wrong. Yes, yes, I know, it’s in my interest to have
    clients in need of documentation for business transactions come to me (or, more
    benevolently, any transactional attorney skilled in drafting) to prepare them
    and not rely on forms they downloaded from the Interwebs. But really, it’s in
    their own interest not to rely on those forms, and I’ll tell you why: 1. A form

    A recent case in Pennsylvania has come to the refreshing, albeit to laymen blindingly
    obvious, conclusion that you can’t use bare grammatical or syntactic “rules” to
    avoid deciding what a contract means based on what the parties intended it to
    mean. In BL Partners Group, LP v. Interbroad LLC () (sadly not a precedental decision),
    a building owner leased a rooftop to BLP for a billboard. The lease, which had
    a 90-year term, included the following language in its termination provision:
    "In the event that Lessor''s building is damaged by fire or other casualty and

    There''s been a flap in the news lately about the genealogy and DNA-testing site
    ancestry.com ("Ancestry"), which among other things offers to test users'' DNA
    to ascertain their national and ethnic ancestry. Their terms of service, which
    (as they will remind you if ever you are in violation of them) constitutes the
    contract between them and the user, was found by one eagle-eyed privacy crusader
    () to contain a license from the user to Ancestry granting it a "perpetual, royalty-free,
    worldwide, sublicensable, transferable license" to the user''s DNA data. Once

    Many times a start-up company will need services, for example software development,
    but doesn’t have the money to pay for them. At that point, many founders offer
    to give their key contributors “a piece of the action” by issuing equity in the
    company in exchange for the services. The services contributor might be willing
    to accept that bargain because the ultimate value of the equity stands to be much
    greater than the value of the time put in. Sounds like a win-win proposition.
    However, there are numerous factors to consider before agreeing to such a deal,
    on both sides of the equ ...read more

    I happened on an infomercial for Intuit''s QuickBooks® accounting program (which
    I neither endorse nor diss) that has some decent advice for small businesses about

    "You''re over-lawyering it!" is one of the most common complaints leveled by a
    client''s representative at a transactional attorney. What usually precipitates
    the comment is when the lawyer returns an agreement drafted by the client''s counter-party
    and the lawyer has lavishly decorated it with comments and edits. It can be quite
    dismaying to see such a document; it means that the negotiating road ahead may
    be steep and rocky, with the date of signature not right around the corner, and
    a very real possibility that there won''t be one at all if it turns out there
